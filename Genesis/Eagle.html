        Eagle is the common name for many large birds of prey of the family Accipitridae.
        Most of the 68 species of eagles are from Eurasia and Africa.[1] Outside this area, just 14 species can be foundâ€”2 in North America, 
        9 in Central and South America, and 3 in Australia. Eagles are not a natural group but denote essentially any kind of bird of prey large enough 
        to hunt sizeable (about 50 cm long or more overall) vertebrates.

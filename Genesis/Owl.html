        Owls are also part of the Bird of Prey family. 
        Owls are divided into two families: the true (or typical) owl family, 
        Strigidae, and the barn-owl family, Tytonidae. Owls hunt mostly small mammals, insects, and other birds, 
        although a few species specialize in hunting fish.

        The tiger is a powerful and awe-inspiring animal. Its coat is a rich, golden-orange hue adorned with characteristic dark, 
        vertical stripes that seem to shimmer in the dappled sunlight. These stripes serve as the tiger's camouflage in its 
        natural habitat, but in the controlled environment of the zoo, they showcase its striking beauty.
